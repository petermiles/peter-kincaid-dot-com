  <div class="prose">
    <p>
      Hey, I'm Pete. I'm a software engineer with 8+ years of experience, most recently as a Senior Frontend Growth Engineer at Apollo.io.
    </p>

    <p>
      I started my career after attending DevMountain coding bootcamp, and I've been hooked on solving hard problems with smart people ever since. My first "job" was actually running a woodcutting business in Runescape when I was 9 years old - I had 10 employees and we moved tens of thousands of logs every week.
    </p>

    <p>
      I write about burnout, career transitions, and the lessons I've learned along the way. My core belief is simple: it's never that important. Your health and happiness should always come first.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I'm not coding, I'm building things with my hands. Currently working on a sauna in my backyard.
